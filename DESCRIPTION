Description: The U.S. Environmental Protection Association has conducted
    two very scientifically-relevant lake surveys. They were done in 2007 and 2012. 
    Unfortunately, the two datasets are slightly different and include different data 
    structures and different observation types. This package attemps to unify key pieces
    of the data and make it directly accessible through R as a simple dependency.
